# Unity1stPersonPlatformer
 A movement shooter style platformer


This was about a months worth of work, and the biggest thing I have made with unity.
Most of my time was just spent figuring out how the basic input, movement and ways to make that fun with the c# scripting

I'm pretty sure its all just super messy and barely readable, but it works. I lost motivation about halfway through which is
why its just a level and and bunch of random platforms. I think I mostly enjoyed just figuring out how the playercontroller
worked, and couldn't find a good substitute for that enthusiasm once I finished making my character movement.

So yeah, spaghetti scripting and low poly but proof is still proof
